# Debugging Analysis

When performing debugging analysis, follow these steps:

## 1. Problem Definition
- Gather detailed error information
- Identify when and where the issue occurs
- Document expected vs actual behavior
- Note any patterns or triggers

## 2. Information Gathering
- Review relevant logs and error messages
- Examine code in affected areas
- Check recent changes
- Consider environmental factors

## 3. Hypothesis Formation
- Develop potential explanations
- Consider similar past issues
- List possible root causes
- Prioritize likely causes

## 4. Verification Planning
- Design steps to verify each hypothesis
- Specify expected outcomes
- Plan for edge cases
- Consider test scenarios

## 5. Analysis Summary
- Document findings clearly
- State hypothesized root cause
- Outline verification steps
- Suggest next actions

## 6. Transition Options
- Proceed to BUG FIX if cause is clear
- Request more information if needed
- Suggest further investigation areas
- Document debugging insights

## Key Principles
- Stay in READ-ONLY mode during analysis
- Focus on understanding, not fixing
- Be systematic and thorough
- Communicate clearly
- Lead to actionable next steps
