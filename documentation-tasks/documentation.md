## **DOCUMENTATION**

Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation to ensure code understandability and long-term maintainability:

1. **Document All Significant Changes**
    * For every enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, or debugging effort that leads to code change, identify necessary documentation updates.
    * Document new features, changes in behavior, and any code modifications that impact understanding.
2. **Choose Appropriate Documentation Types**
    * Use code comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, and non-obvious code sections.
    * Generate API documentation for public interfaces and libraries.
    * Update user guides or README files for user-facing changes.
    * Consider architecture diagrams for complex system designs.
    3. **Maintain Consistent Style**
    * Follow a consistent style for code comments and documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Markdown).
    * Use clear and concise language.
    * Ensure documentation is easily accessible and discoverable.
    4. **Keep Documentation Current**
    * Update documentation whenever code is changed.
    * Review documentation regularly to ensure accuracy and relevance.
    * Integrate documentation updates into your development workflow.
